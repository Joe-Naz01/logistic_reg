# logistic_reg
A Python-based machine learning project that explores the impact of the L2 regularization parameter (C) on a Logistic Regression model. The project uses the Scikit-learn 'digits' dataset to visualize decision boundaries and plot training vs. validation error rates to identify optimal hyperparameter values.
